  "content"  : "1. Introduction\nAPIs, or application programming interfaces, have been present in the field of computer programming for decades. However, in recent years, they have gained much more relevance in the hyperconnected world we live in today.\n1.1 Objectives\nThe main objective of this document is to present the API first approach as a model for organizing the design and development of software, recognizing the current importance of APIs in the world. It also aims to understand their lifecycle and how the model offers advantages in terms of implementation times, development costs, and maintenance, among others.\nAs an introduction to the topic, both the advantages and disadvantages are presented. However, the document will not delve into development methodologies, and although modern API development technologies are mentioned, the goal is not to present all options in detail.\n1.2 Document Organization\nThe document is divided into the following parts:\n\n  API Economy: Presents how a market has formed around APIs, which is constantly expanding.\n  API First Strategy: Describes the software development model required to take advantage of the API economy.\n  Benefits of API First: Specific points about the advantages of using the development model are discussed.\n  Implementation Example: A practical case is provided.\n  Integration Costs: More details about the associated costs of integrating APIs and how the API first approach can reduce them.\n  API First Challenges: Potential obstacles and limitations of the API first approach are examined.\n  Conclusion and Future Directions: Final thoughts on the topic.\n \n    2. API Economy\n  \n\n\nThe importance of APIs lies in their function as intermediaries between two applications that need to share information. These interfaces define how applications should interact with each other, which requests and responses are allowed, and what data formats they will accept. This allows a system to provide external connectivity by exposing objects and actions without needing to reveal its internal implementation.\n\nOver the last two decades, APIs have become an integral part of any modern software development, revolutionizing industries. They have enabled greater connectivity between different organizations, regardless of geographical location, and have transformed the way we communicate. Additionally, with innovations such as generative artificial intelligence, blockchain, and other emerging technologies, the use of APIs continues to grow at an accelerated pace.\nA widely known example is the map service offered by Google. The company allows third parties to consume its mapping service through a well-defined and documented set of APIs. This has led many individuals and companies to incorporate map functionality directly into their applications, which is essential in cases like ride-sharing services that require the user’s geographical location.\n\nThis example illustrates why service providers are interested in monetizing their APIs, as they can generate a steady stream of income due to the large number of calls to their services. This has led to what we now call the API economy. Since in most cases there is not a single service provider but several companies offering similar services, the market opens up to competition. Developers tend to opt for the service that offers the best features at the best price.\nThe API economy is not only about offering services in the market, but also about the need for skilled personnel to implement these APIs to meet customer needs. Often, this work is carried out by integration service companies.\nIntegration is not limited to programming to consume the APIs. It involves extensive testing to ensure that data flows correctly between the systems involved. This includes unit testing to verify that individual API functions work as expected, integration testing to assess interoperability between different APIs, and load and performance testing to ensure that the integrations can handle significant workloads without speed or capacity issues.\nIn summary, the API economy encompasses both the offering of services for the interoperability of external processes and the offering of integration services. In a constantly evolving market environment, companies and technology leaders have accelerated the use and integration of APIs, which presents the challenge of consuming them securely and efficiently, considering aspects such as the API first model and the measurement of benefits in terms of implementation and development and maintenance costs.\n \n3. API First Strategy\n\nThe term API first refers to an approach in software development that places the creation of APIs at the center of the development process. With this strategy, the planning of how data will be exposed in a logical and easy-to-consume way is prioritized, along with the implementation of security measures to protect the data. The result is a modular system that integrates effectively with other software systems, facilitating the addition of new functions and features in the future without needing to rewrite the entire system.\n\nThe API first approach is not only relevant for companies offering services through these interfaces but also for those consuming services provided by third parties or other internal departments. The creation and design of APIs are an essential part of the critical infrastructure in any organization.\n\nJust like a building is not constructed without complete blueprints reviewed by all stakeholders, the API first methodology requires a complete design of the data and system connectivity before writing a single line of code. This design phase allows for changes at minimal cost since the details are documented. Additionally, all involved teams, from development to marketing and API support, have the opportunity to make revisions that lead to a robust and thoroughly tested design. This allows the engineering team to develop the system with clarity and efficiency and provides the interface that will allow third parties to connect to the system in the future without having to wait for the services behind the APIs to be fully completed.\n\nAPI first is not just a development methodology; it represents a shift in the prioritization of design phases, making APIs an integral part of the product, not a byproduct or an additional task. The goal is to create a set of consistent and reusable APIs through clear documentation that describes their behavior. In this sense, API description languages like OpenAPI or RAML can be used to ensure a complete design with all the details of inputs, outputs, and possible errors at each endpoint, facilitating third-party consumption.\n\nAlthough it may seem like a return to waterfall methodologies, planning in an agile development environment is feasible. During the design phase, API emulators or facades can be used to evaluate their effectiveness and make design changes without writing all the code to get real responses. These facades also allow different stakeholders to start designing and even implementing the client code that will consume the APIs without depending on the completion of the underlying functionality.\n\nAn important outcome of the API first strategy is the creation of a system architecture where APIs are the core of communication between applications and business functions. This facilitates the delivery of consistent features across all available digital channels, both now and in the future.\nAmong the concrete advantages of adopting an API first approach are a reduction in development time, allowing multiple teams to work simultaneously on implementing data services and their consumers without waiting for one to be completed before starting the other.\n \n4. Benefits of API First\n\nThe adoption of the API first strategy in software development, whether for internal use or for interoperability with third parties, offers a series of competitive advantages that can be measured directly in terms of revenue, efficiency, and flexibility. Below are some of the most notable benefits:\n\n4.1 Faster Time to Market\nBy prioritizing API design from the beginning, developers can work simultaneously on the communication between different system components. This is because there is a clear contract that dictates how data flows between components. As a result, teams don’t need to wait for an API to be fully functional to start consuming it or conducting tests. This speeds up the development process, allowing new products or features to reach the market more quickly, giving the company a competitive advantage by being able to introduce innovations swiftly.\n4.2 Improved Scalability and Flexibility\nAPIs provide a flexible foundation that facilitates system scalability. When APIs are considered from the start, companies can easily add new functionalities, integrate third-party services, and adapt to changing business needs. This flexibility is particularly beneficial in agile development, where the rapid delivery of software is essential. This agility allows companies to stay ahead of the competition and quickly respond to market demands.\n4.3 Enhanced Collaboration and Partnerships\nAPIs enable seamless integration with external partners and developers, fostering greater collaboration outside the company. By exposing their APIs, companies can attract external developers to build complementary applications and services on their platforms, which expands the ecosystem and broadens the audience reach. This collaboration drives innovation, attracts customers, and generates new revenue streams. Additionally, it strengthens partner and consumer loyalty since the investment in integrating with a company’s APIs makes it costly to switch to a different provider.\n4.4 Revenue Opportunities\nAPIs can be a valuable resource for generating additional income. By offering them as a service to external developers or companies, a new source of revenue is created. Providing well-documented and valuable APIs attracts developers and partners willing to pay for access, which can lead to new revenue streams and strengthen the company’s market position. Moreover, this strategy opens the door for companies to offer integration services between service providers and consumers, which in turn can generate additional income.\nAPI providers can even add value by offering a development kit in various programming languages that facilitates integration, reducing costs and simplifying the process. This allows each customer to save resources by not having to carry out exhaustive tests separately since these tests can be included as part of the publication of these libraries, ensuring high performance and security.\n4.5 Cost Reduction\nThe API first approach also offers the advantage of reducing maintenance and upgrade costs. A standardized set of APIs reduces complexity, minimizes the duplication of efforts, and improves scalability. Moreover, companies can leverage standards and best practices published by industry leaders like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook, among others, to optimize the implementation of API routes, the format of exchanged data, and authorization standards. This leads to greater efficiency during design by adopting such practices and better adherence to proven standards in the global market.\n \n5. Implementation Example\n\nThe development of any modern software product involving API creation or integration is rarely a linear task with a clear start and finish. It is more of an iterative cycle where, with each iteration, functionalities are added, performance is improved, and existing implementation errors are fixed.\nBelow is a description of a company that sought to update the APIs available to its customers and integrators, used both for extracting and inserting or updating data. The APIs had been written as an additional product with the goal of offering communication functionality through a program. However, no proper planning was done, and different teams added APIs to expose system objects, resulting in inconsistencies in field naming and lack of adherence to any communication standards.\n\nWith the initial objective of exposing system objects via APIs to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations whenever required by the business, the API development cycle was adopted with strong planning at the start to determine what infrastructure needed to be built. The following suggested steps for API development were followed:\n\n  The objective of the APIs was first defined, focusing on making the application objects available for customer consumption.\n  The APIs were designed following the suggestions of modern APIs adhering to the REST model, aiming for consistency when putting them into production. To maintain internal consistency, a data model with uniform names was created, and automated tools were used to ensure that the API definitions remained consistent. These tools also allowed the generation of the final code automatically, without needing to individually program each API. It was also agreed to gradually release the new version of the APIs so that customers could benefit from the new version for the most used objects first, and then gradually for the remaining objects.\n  A unified library was developed, which takes a formal definition of each object that needs to be exposed through an API and generates the required code to expose the functionality using the existing service. This allowed the API code creation to be introduced into an automated build pipeline, following modern Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment practices.\n  With a way to generate APIs from a definition of the objects in an automated build pipeline, unit and functional tests could be added to the produced APIs. This ensured that any change to the data contract or functionality would cause a build break and require developers to assess whether the change was acceptable or if a redesign was needed to avoid affecting the expected functionality for consumers.\n  The final step was the deployment of the produced APIs for public availability. This also required planning the observation of the APIs to measure their effectiveness and proactively address any issues.\nThe steps described above constitute the API lifecycle that my team defined. With each iteration of the cycle, new objects were added to the company’s offering, as well as new functionalities to the existing APIs. Since the design was clear from the beginning and adhered to standards, and we had automated tests at every stage to ensure that new changes did not introduce errors or undesired changes, we were able to migrate from previous versions very quickly.\nSecurity and performance tests could also be run each time a new set of APIs became available or when changes were made to the code generation libraries. This made it part of the build pipeline to constantly obtain data on performance and scalability.\n\n\nA team of five developers focused on building the infrastructure to produce the APIs, adding the necessary instrumentation to measure the amount of data flowing through the new APIs and the format of the data itself, which allowed us to make improvements and plan which objects should be made available in each cycle. Over a period of three years, we delivered a set of 26 APIs with consistent naming, adhering to REST standards, and with the necessary instrumentation that provided us with data on traffic and usage of the APIs.\n\nWe reduced the support call rate by more than 80% due to the new versions having uniform names and functionality. Since they adhered to REST standards, the API responses were consistent across all of them. And by running performance tests constantly, we ensured that our consumers had a satisfying experience.\n\nAnother advantage we achieved was that, by having a unified development model using a formal API definition language, adding new objects and making them available for customer consumption became extremely simple, requiring less than a week of work for a developer to deliver a new object.\n \n6. Integration Costs\n\nFor a company that needs to integrate third-party APIs, there will always be additional costs and complexities for customers. These costs typically include hiring integrators or developers to perform the initial connectivity, and they will likely need to continue employing their services for updates and maintenance. While this can be challenging, it is important to note that with an API first approach, significant savings can be realized, adding value to customers. I will explore these options below.\n6.1 Initial Integration Efficiency\nThe API first approach ensures that APIs are fully documented and designed for ease of use and connectivity. This leads to a significant reduction in the time and effort required for initial integration. This is where the added value of an integrator with experienced personnel in the field of integrations comes into play. APIs that follow standards and are accompanied by clear documentation allow developers to understand and implement them efficiently.\n6.2 Long-Term Savings\nThe cost of integration, as described in the previous section, can be understood as the initial cost, but it must also include an ongoing maintenance cost. By using standardized APIs, long-term savings are often realized since updates to APIs designed for a long lifespan are usually backward compatible. This means that with each update, customers do not have to rewrite their integration to accommodate new versions.\nSome companies offer support for older versions of APIs, which, while not providing all the functionalities of new products, do not force customers to migrate to new versions if they do not need to consume the new features.\n6.3 Scalability and Versatility\nAdopting an API first approach gives customers the ability to integrate numerous third-party services, providing considerable flexibility. While integration carries costs, the ability to choose from a wide range of services to build a complete product reduces the need for future modifications. This results in lower long-term maintenance and operational costs.\n\n7. API First Challenges\n\nDespite the significant benefits of the API first approach previously discussed, there are also limitations and potential risks to consider:\n7.1 Initial Investment\nTransitioning to an API first approach requires an initial investment in infrastructure, technology, and training. Companies will need to allocate resources to redesign existing systems, create standards-compliant APIs, and train developers. For fully established companies, the initial investment can be substantial.\n7.2 Complexity and Maintenance\nMaintaining permanently operational servers and having monitoring and alert services to detect and fix failures are required to ensure the reliability and security of APIs. Currently, cloud service providers such as Amazon, Google, or Microsoft have made the total operational costs much lower compared to a company handling the installation and operation of all infrastructure themselves. However, this is not a negligible cost and requires personnel who can take advantage of these services.\nTo offer APIs to third parties, companies must provide documentation and maintain it to ensure that it meets the needs of both internal and external clients. Maintaining compatibility when releasing new API versions requires careful planning and execution.\n7.3 Organizational and Cultural Changes\nShifting to an API first approach involves a mindset change and necessitates cultural and organizational changes within the company. This may require breaking down communication barriers between different teams, promoting collaboration, and sharing ownership and responsibility for APIs throughout the company. People tend to resist change to varying degrees, and a lack of interest from management levels or internal disagreements among executives can jeopardize a successful implementation of the API first approach.\n7.4 Security and Regulatory Risks\nOffering APIs to external developers and partners can introduce security risks, such as unauthorized access to sensitive or private data, abuse of API calls, and compliance violations. Companies must implement robust security measures, including authentication, authorization, encryption, and monitoring, to mitigate risks. They must also keep up with ever-changing regulatory requirements, which can vary significantly across different markets, as seen with the introduction of GDPR in the European Union or CCPA in the United States, to name a few.\n \n8. Conclusion and Future Directions\nWith the previously outlined advantages and disadvantages, we can understand why a company that opts to adopt an API first approach will experience significant improvements in product and software service development costs, leading to greater satisfaction for both customers and partners. This, in turn, will result in a stronger market position and ultimately translate into increased profits and greater long-term stability.\nTo delve deeper into this topic, it is recommended to explore the lifecycle of APIs and familiarize oneself with the methodologies and tools for their management, as well as to investigate the concept of monetization to diversify the company’s revenue sources.\n\nThis document serves as an introduction to the API first approach. However, it is important to highlight that in the field of internet development, the topic of APIs is constantly evolving. New trends are being incorporated to fully leverage the connectivity that the network offers, focusing on aspects such as security, data transmission optimization, and cost reduction related to both development and consumption of available services.\nIn summary, the API economy has transformed the way companies grow and remain relevant in today’s technological environment. The API first strategy brings agility, innovation, and the ability to create value in a hyperconnected digital world.\n \nReferences\n\n  Cloudflare. (n.d.).

  "content"  : "Una de las devociones cristianas más hermosas es meditar la vida de nuestro Señor\nJesucristo en compañía de su santa madre. Aunque no me considero experto en el tema,\nsi quiero compartir este excelente ejercicio espiritual diaro y entonces aquí\npresento una breve introducción a como rezar el rosario. Para una explicación detallada\nsugiero leer la carta “Rosarium Virginis Mariae” de San Juan Pablo II.\n\nEl rosario puede ser también una actividad en grupo, para lo cual hay algunas\npequeñas reglas para hacerlo sumamente interactivo de tal manera que todos\nparticipen por igual, pero manteniendo una persona que lo dirija, y es exactamente\nel mismo formato cuando se hace con una sola persona.\n\nUna búsqueda en internet te regresará distintas ligas con algunas pequeñas variaciones\nde como iniciar, y como cerrar tu oración del rosario. Aquí presento el formato que\nmás ha funcionado para mi.\n\nVoy a iniciar indicando el formato y voy a poner el texto completo de las oraciones\ndespués, incluyendo los grupos de misterios separados por día de la semana.\n\nÓrden del rosario.\n\nInicio\nSignarse\nHacemos la señal de la cruz en la frente, luego en la boca y luego en el pecho. mientras\nrepetimos:\n\n\n  \n    \n      Por la señal de la Santa Cruz, de nuestros enemigos líbranos Señor, Dios nuestro. En el nombre del Padre, y del Hijo, y del Espíritu Santo. Amén.\n    \n  \n\n\nCredo y acto de contrición\n\n\n  \n    \n      Credo de los Apóstoles\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Creo en Dios, Padre todo poderoso, creador del cielo y de la tierra. Creo en Jesucristo, su único Hijo, nuestro Señor, que fue concebido por obra y gracia del Espíritu Santo, nació de santa María Virgen, padeció bajo el poder de Poncio Pilato, fue crucificado, muerto y sepultado, descendió a los infiernos, al tercer día resucitó de entre los muertos, subió a los cielos y está sentado a la derecha de dios, Padre todo poderoso. Desde allí ha de venir a juzgar a vivos y muertos. Creo en el Espíritu Santo, la santa iglesia Católica, la comunión de los santos, el perdón de los pecados, la resurrección de la carne y la vida eterna. Amén.\n    \n    \n      Acto de contrición (opcional)\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Jesús, Dios y hombre verdadero, Creador, Padre y Redentor mío; por que tú eres bondad infinita, y porque te amo sobre todas las cosas, me pesa de todo corazón haberte ofendido, también me pesa porque puedes castigarme con las penas del infierno. Por eso propongo con tu gracia, enmendarme, confesarme, alejarme de las ocasiones de pecado y cumplir la penitencia que me fuera impuesta. Confio en que me perdonarás por tu infinita misericordia. Amén\n    \n  \n\n\nTres Ave María\n\nMisterios\n\nEl rosario tiene 5 grupos de diez cuentas separados por una única cuenta. Cada grupo de diez cuentas se llama una década.\nPara poder entrar en la década, el que dirige el rosario debe enunciar el misterio, seguido por un Padre Nuestro.\nUn Misterio es un episodio de la vida de nuestro Señor Jeuscristo el cual meditamos durante cada una de las diez cuentas\njunto con la madre de nuestro señor y es por eso que en cada cuenta se reza un Ave María. Luego se termina la década con una o más jaculatorias.\n\nJaculatorias\n\nUna jaculatoria es una oración corta llena de amor y devoción con la que nos comunicamos con nuestro Señor Padre,\nsu hijo Jesucristo, la santa Virgen María y el Espíritu Santo. Su finalidad es mantenernos bajo la gracia de Dios\na lo largo del día, todos los días de nuestra vida.\n\n\n  \n    \n      María, madre de gracia, madre de misericordia: En la vida y en la muerte ampáranos gran señora\n    \n    \n      Oh Jesús mío: Perdona nuestros pecados, sálvanos de las llamas y del fuego del infierno.

  "content"  : "This is another article in the group of data structures.\n\nA hash map is a powerful in-memory data structure that allows adding and retrieving data in a constant time.\nMost modern languages have support for this and usually they include variations and optimizations over it,\ntherefore most of us take this for granted, but this was not always the case, and here I try to explain\nhow this one works.\n\nThe basic data structure supported by any programming language is the array. An array is a contiguous block of memory\nset aside to store the same type of data. For example an array of 10 integers, will occupy in a 64 bit machine 80 bytes.\nAn array is quite powerful because you can write and retrieve values from and to the array by using a single\noperation, which is denoted as O(1) using the Big O notation.\n\nWhat a hash map solves is a problem where we want to have a set of data indexed instead of by numbers, by an\narbitrary type of data, this is known as an associative array because each value in the array is associated with a key\ninstead of a numeric index assigned by the value’s position within the array. But of course the order of the data\nwithin the associative array is not given by any position. Conceptually it can be visualized as the following image:\n\n\n\nIn the left hand side we have a basic array, indexed by the position in memory (and this is the reason why an array\n  starts with index 0), while on the right hand side we have an associative array indexed by an arbitrary key. If we stored\n  any value in the element associated with “alpha” we would be overwriting the element there.\n\nThe way to achieve this, first is to create an array with a fixed size that is capable of holding as many\nelements as we need, and then using a hash function that translates the key into a unique integer value.\nOnce we have an integer value, we can simply calculate the hash key modulo the size of the array to find\nthe location of the element in the array.\n\nHaving a unique key and having the same key every time each element requires computing it is a must for the above\ndescription to work. What happens after that with the key can change depending on the implementation. Having a large\ninteger module a shorter one (the size of the array) will lead inevitably to what is called collisions. That means two or more\nkeys will end up pointing to the same element in the array. To solve the collision, one way is to generate\na single linked list that starts in the element of the array indicated by the hash key. Another option is to start\ncalculating the (key + i) modulo (array size). Here i will mean how many iterations have to happen for us to find\nan empty spot in the table. In my opinion the first one is a cleaner one and the one I have used for years.\n\nIf we wanted to calculate a simple hash value for the string in the input box below, we can use the following code\n\nfunction hashForString(str) {\n  var total = 0;\n  for(i = 0; i &amp;lt; str.length; i++) {\n    total += str.charCodeAt(i);\n  };\n  return total;\n}\n\nEnter text:  Hash: \n\nJavascript already provides associative arrays built, therefore there is no need to create a hash map, however\nfor example purposes we can implement a simple one following the guidelines above with the following code,\ninstead of writing pseudocode I prefer giving fully working javascript that can be run in this same browser\nor adapted to your preferred language.\n\n// Holds the key value pair, as is the basis for a simple linked list\nclass Node {\n  constructor(key, value) {\n    this.key = key;\n    this.value = value;\n    this.next = null;\n  }\n}\n\nclass HashMap {\n  constructor() {\n    // We use for example a 20 element array.\n    this.table = new Array(20);\n    for(var i =0; i &amp;lt; 20; i++) {\n      this.table[i] = null;\n    }\n  }\n\n  put(key, value) {\n    // as usual validation, just make sure both the key and the value are valid\n    if (typeof(key) === &#39;undefined&#39; || typeof(value) === &#39;undefined&#39;)\n      return;\n    var hash = hashForString(key) % 20;\n    if (!this.table[hash]) {\n      this.table[hash] = new Node(key, value);\n    } else {\n      // this code happens in case of (hash % 20) collisions\n      var node = this.table[hash];\n      while (node.next != null) {\n        node = node.next;\n      }\n      node.next = new Node(key, value);\n    }\n  }\n\n  get(key) {\n    if (typeof(key) === &#39;undefined&#39;)\n      return;\n    var hash = hashForString(key) % 20;\n    var node = this.table[hash];\n    // we start on the first node in the table\n    // and iterate until we reach the end or the requested key\n    while (node != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; node.key !== key) {\n      node = node.next;\n    }\n    if (node) {\n      return node.value;\n    } else {\n      return 0;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // an example of how to use it:\n  var hm = new HashMap();\n  hm.put(&quot;one&quot;, &quot;text 1&quot;);\n  hm.put(&quot;two&quot;, &quot;text 2&quot;);\n  console.log(hm.get(&quot;one&quot;));\n  console.log(hm.get(&quot;two&quot;));\n\nPlease let me know below your comments, and what other programming challenges you would like to get explained here.\n"

Right now it is a work in progress, please\nkeep looking for updates for this post, as I will keep working on it.\n\nThere will be a graphical representation of the tree in the are below that you can use to visualize the operations\nas I keep progressing in this code.\n\n\n\nNumber:\n\nInsert\nSearch\n\nFirst we have to define the basic piece, and that is going to be a Node:\n\nclass Node {\n  constructor(data) {\n    this.data = data;\n    this.left = null;\n    this.right = null;\n  }\n  // ... other methods will go here\n}\n\nThe JavaScript constructor takes a value to store in the current node as the value, and also\nsets the pointers to the left and right nodes as null. This is important to make sure the variables\ndon’t remain as undefined and also that they exist when accessing them from other methods.\n\nAs for the methods, let’s start by implementing the insert. The core of the algorithm is to check\nif the new data has to go either to the left, or to the right, and then call the same insert recursively\nfrom the chosen node, like the code below that returns a boolean value to indicate whether the new value\nwas inserted or not:\n\n// ...\n  insert(node) {    \n    // First make sure we are inserting data but we also prevent duplicates\n    if (node == null || typeof(node) == &#39;undefined&#39; || this.data === node.data) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    // now chose whether go left\n    if (this.data &amp;gt; node.data) {\n      if (this.left === null) {\n        this.left = node;\n        return true;\n      }\n      return this.left.insert(node);\n    } else {\n      // or go right\n      if (this.right === null) {\n        this.right = node;\n        return true;\n      }\n      return this.right.insert(node);\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n// ...\n\n"

  "content"  : "This is a sample block to read a list of names, order them and also create a random ordered list. The code even allows to drag and drop files into the text area for easier manipulation of long lists, and also to avoid storing any data on our server - because there is no need to do it.\n\nThe working area is next and below that is the description of the code\n\nEnter a list of names:\n\n\n\nGo\n\n\n  \n    \n      Ordered\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      Randomized\n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nDescription of the code\n\nJavascript file in github\n\nTo read the names, the code takes the contents of the textarea and puts it into an array line by line to be able to manipulate it. JQuery makes it easy by using the textarea locator, retrieving the value and the using split() by newline, then sorting is native in javascript for an array:\n\nvar names = $(&#39;#names&#39;).val().split(&quot;\\n&quot;);\nnames.sort();\n\nJavascript provides a pseudo-random number generator that produces number in the range (0, 1). For the case presented here we need an integer number in the range [0, names.length] for that we can write a simple function to take an upper boundary and produce a pseudo-random integer in that range:\n\nrandom = function(bound) {\n  return Math.floor(Math.random() * bound);\n}\n\nTo be able to generate a random list, the code needs to iterate through the whole list of names and randomly select a new position for every entry:\n\nfor(i = 0; i &amp;lt; names.length; i++) {\n  var dest = random(names.length);\n  if (dest != i) {\n    var t = names[dest];\n    names[dest] = names[i];\n    names[i] = t;\n  }\n}\n\nHandling files\nTo be able to manipulate files, the browser will generate events related to drag and drop, for which the program needs to handle dragOver, dragEnter, and drop. Within the drop handler, the program can instantiate the HTML5 FileReader object, that will read the local file. The reader works on events to avoid blocking the main (and only) thread executing the script. Within the handler of the reader, I load the contents of the file into the textarea using JQuery $.text() method.\n\nvar reader = new FileReader();\nreader.addEventListener(&quot;load&quot;, function () {\n    var fileText = reader.result;\n    $(&#39;#names&#39;).text(fileText);\n}, false);\nreader.readAsText(file);\n\nConclusion\n\nReading a file is now part HTML5, array manipulation is done easily with javascript, and that includes the sort method, as well as a pseudo-random number generator. Javascript provides also handling of the DOM but in this case I opted for JQuery which in my opinion is easier to read.\n"

  "content"  : "This is the first article in a series that aims to cover common data structures.\n\nA binary search tree is an in-memory data structure whose purpose in life is to make\nultra fast searches even through large amounts of data. The main downside of this\nstructure is the need for the data to be ordered.\n\nLet’s start first by identifying why a binary search is so fast. If we have an array as shown\nin the image below, with elements a fixed number of elements in it as long as they are\nsorted we can use what is called a binary search to find if an element is contained in the array or not.\n\n\n\nA binary search purpose is to eliminate half of the data in every iteration slicing each\ntime the amount of data that needs to be searched. In the array above, we would start by\nlooking at the element in the middle ( n/2 ). If the data we are looking for is there\nour search is done. The next step is the one that makes the split it half. If the\nelement we are looking for is less than the middle, then we repeat the search in the\nmiddle left, otherwise we repeat the search in the middle right. And then repeat the\nsame sequence as you can see in the images below.\n\n\n\nEventually we will find the element we are looking for, or we would traverse the whole dataset\nin the minimum number possible of steps making sure the element is not there. Keep in mind that\nthis algorithm takes into account the fact that the data within the array is already ordered\nusing the same criteria that will be used to search within it. If you need to start with\nunsorted data, then you need to sort it first.\n\nNow let’s take this to the next level. What if each element within the array was uniquely placed in memory\nwith a simple way of reaching to the elements on the left, or the elements on the right? But each of those\nsets of elements need to maintain the same rule. That is what we can refer to as a node.\nA Node is going to have 3 pieces to it:\n\n  Data\n  A pointer to a node on the left\n  A pointer to a node on the right\n\n\nEach node will point in turn to another node, or when the node doesn’t have any left or right pointers, it is called a leaf.\nIn the example below, you can see the node in the middle has the value of 100 - and this is called the root,\nbecause it is our entry point into the tree. All the data on the left hand side of the root is less than 100\nwhile all the nodes on the right will have values larger than 100.\n\n\n\nWith such a tree, we can easily create a recursive search algorithm. The following\npiece of code is written in Java:\n\npublic class BinarySearchTree {\n  //... This is a snippet\n  public class Node\n  {\n    private Data data = NULL; // we assume Data is defined and can be compared\n    private Node left = NULL;\n    private Node right = NULL;\n\n    public Node getLeft() { return left; }\n    public Node getRight() { return right; }\n    public Data getData() { return data; }\n  }\n\n  Node search(Node node, Data target)\n  {\n    if (node.getData() == target) {\n      return node;\n    }\n    if (target &amp;lt; node.getData() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; node.getLeft() != NULL) {\n      return search(node.left, target);\n    }\n    if (target &amp;gt; node.getData() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; node.getRight() != NULL) {\n      return search(node.right, target);\n    }\n    return NULL;\n  }\n}\n\n\nBelow is the same approach but written in C++\n\nstruct Node\n{\n    Data* data; // NodeData is defined somewhere else and is comparable\n    Node* left = NULL;\n    Node* right = NULL;\n};\n\nNode* search(Node *node, Data &amp;amp;target)\n{\n  if (!node) {\n    return NULL;\n  }\n  if (*node-&amp;gt;data == target) {\n    return node;\n  }\n  if (target &amp;lt; *node-&amp;gt;data &amp;amp;&amp;amp; node-&amp;gt;left) {\n    return search(node-&amp;gt;left, target);\n  }\n  if (target &amp;gt; *node-&amp;gt;data &amp;amp;&amp;amp; node-&amp;gt;right) {\n    return search(node-&amp;gt;right, target);\n  }\n  return NULL;\n}\n\nStay tuned, because in future articles I will add more operations to the Binary Search Tree and will\nalso talk about optimizing the code utilizing more object oriented principles and strengths\nof Java and C++.\n"

  "content"  : "As we decided to get a travel trailer,\nwe quickly discovered that a towing capacity\nstated in the manual of my car is not actually even remotely the only value needed to safely tow a trailer.\n\n\nThe result has to do with the relationship between the payload capacity – or cargo capacity - of the vehicle,\nalso called TV (Towing Vehicle), and the tongue weight.\nThe tongue weight is usually 10% – 15% of the overall trailer weight when properly distributed.\n\nFirst you have to start looking for the data required to do the calculation\neither online or on your vehicle’s manual. The words used to describe everything are\npretty descriptive, but it is a lot of lingo and it takes some time to make them part of your day to day\nvocabulary.\n\nFor the vehicle, you need to find the following:\n\n  Curb Weight: which is the weight of the vehicle without any passengers or cargo.\nYou can find that in your vehicle’s manual, on a sticker on the driver’s side, or on the manufacturer’s website.\n  GVWR or Gross Vehicle Weight Rating. This is also in the manual and usually on the driver’s side sticker, and it is the max weight the vehicle can have. Make sure you never exceed this value for any reason because you can put your life and other’s at risk.\n  GCVWR or Gross Combined Vehicle Weight Rating. Sometimes found on the driver’s side sticker, or the manual. It refers to how much weight can be carried by the vehicle including the trailer, hence the word Combined.\n  Payload or Cargo capacity. This number should be the GVWR minus the curb weight. Giving you how much fuel, baggage and occupants can go safely into the vehicle. This value also is used to carry the tongue of the trailer.\n  Towing capacity. Stated in the manual. This is usually not that useful because you can’t tow more than the GCVWR minus the GVWR, but this gives you a sense of security that your vehicle was built with extra capacity in several parts that make it safe to reach the limit.\n\n\nFor the trailer, you need 3 values:\n\n  UVW or Unloaded Vehicle Weight. Which is the weight from the factory without dealer options, but it usually includes full tanks of propane.\n  GVWR. Same as the vehicle. This is the maximum weight the trailer can carry.\n  Hitch Weight. It should be 10% - 15% of the overall weight of the trailer.\n\n\nThis is where things start getting more difficult. But for simplicity you should assume you\nwill be carrying your trailer fully loaded - that’s at the GVWR for any required calculation\nincluding the weight of the hitch. That will give you enough leeway.\n\nAs you can see, all those names are kind of confusing in the beginning, but as you start getting\nfamiliar with them, it becomes easier to understand how much you can actually tow safely.\nAgain never exceed the GVWR and GCVWR set by the manufacturer. You can find some tricks on the\ninternet to increase the payload capacity of your truck, specially by upgrading the tires, but\nthat doesn’t mean the overall GCVWR can go up, and that is because the manufacturer already\nqualified all the components for such rating and it states that such value is safe for operation.\nThink about it this way: if you are in an accident and you are found at fault, your insurance\nmay refuse to pay if you are found to have exceeded your vehicle capabilities in any way.\n\nTo make it easier to take into account all the values that I mentioned above,\nI used the data and formulas from the guys at\nKeep Your Daydream and I wrote a simple online calculator.\n\nIs it open source? Well of course it is, but even better, you can access it\nfrom your phone or computer. I also added the calculator to this website.\n\nHopefully it works for a lot of people and please leave a comment here if you use it.\n"

  "content"  : "Having a water feature in the backyard is always nice, but there are\nsome steps to maintain the feature that come along with any installation.\nIf properly cared for the feature can last for years and give a nice touch\nto your house.\n\nIt all started after few years we put sod in my backyard. It is below grade, what means\nthere is a slope from the front porch to the backyard, that makes it pretty much at\nthe basement level. Because of this situation, the backyard doesn’t drain much, and it\nremains wet most of the year. It is usually good to keep the grass green all year long.\nThe problem was that we didn’t notice the grass was wet naturally because we setup\na timer with a sprinkler that took care of watering my backyard sod all summer long.\n\nAfter two years, a big portion of the backyard was too wet and died, I guess you can stay\nit drowned. At that point we could either put more sod, but with proper cleanup first or\nbuild some water feature that could cover the area that was lost. It was not that bad,\nprobably around 190 to 250 square feet needed some fixing. Also I have this fascination\nfor fish tanks, which then took to the next level and finally decided to build a pond.\n\nDeciding on the location was the easiest thing, because I explained above, the grass\nwas already dead in a large area, and we needed to cover it with something. Then we opted\nfor a prefab hard shell\nsimilar to the one shown below.\n\nThe process was more work than planning after that.\nIt should start with digging a hole big enough to fit the pond, but in preparation for\ndigging, having the shape in the ground makes the process a somewhat easier. What I mean is\ntaking the liner and placing it upside down over the ground, then using some\nRust-Oleum Marking Spray Paint to draw\nthe shape and make the whole reach those edges.\n\nAs I mentioned before there is a slope that goes from the front of my property to the backyard\nand we used this opportunity to use the extra dirt and start shaping some stairs (that eventually\ncompleted) and that took care of the extra dirt. It took me and my son two days to finish digging\nthe whole. Meanwhile my wife purchased a few bags of gravel from the local hardware store along\nwith couple of decorative plants.\n\nWhen placing the prefab it is important to check for proper leveling, otherwise the water will get out of the pond.\nIt is just common sense. And then it is time to fill back all the edges of the prefab with some of the dirt\nthat was dug out earlier. Place the plants near the edge of the pond, and put the gravel around the pond.\n\nBefore introducing any fish or plants into the pond, we decided to fill it with water to the middle, to kind of\nwash out all the dirt during the process. Then dumped the water out by using the hose as a syphon. I’m glad\nwe did it because a lot of debris fell into the liner just by filling the holes around it and when doing\nthe plants.\n\nNext should be the filter. When visiting the hardware store, I asked about pond supplies and they have a good variety\nbut boy those are expensive. Thankfully Amazon came to the rescue and found the same InPond 5 in 1\nmodel but for about 80% of the store price, with next day delivery. We chose that because the guys at\nthe hardware store recommended - that made it easier when navigating all the options in Amazon.\nIt contains an ultra-violet lamp that gets rid of organic matter entering the filter and several biological\nand mechanical filters that require little maintenance. It also comes with a fountain and it just looks cool.\nInstalling the filter was really easy. Just follow the included instructions and place it in the center of the pond.\n\nAt this moment, the next step was to let the filter run for a few days before introducing the fish.\nWhen visiting the pet store we didn’t really have any high expectations, therefore we purchased\na dozen of comet gold fish like for 35 cents each. They were tiny - about half an inch. Also with the filter we\nstarted an amazon subscription for fish food, again after a recommendation from the pet store, but\nthe price at amazon is just so much better and the subscription quite convenient. If you didn’t know, Amazon offers a “Subscribe &amp;amp; Save” option in several of their products, which for me works like a charm sending me the needed fish food every quarter and at the same time it reduces the price even more!\n\nAnd that was it! The finished product is shown below:\n\n\nA short video\n\n\nIt has been already two years since we installed the pond. Half of the fish died during the first two weeks.\nBut the other six survived and started growing at regular rate. Whenever we leave on vacation we ask some\nof our neighbors to feed the fish once a day.\n\nThe filter requires regular maintenance, every 2-3 months cleaning and changing the carbon filters. And so far after 1 and a half years we had to change the light bulb for a new one.  And that is pretty much all the maintenance.\n"
